# MyOTA test deployment

This Fleet bundle deploys the shared MyOTA chart into `myota-test` using the
mutable GHCR `testing` tags pinned to immutable digests. A digest change alters
the pod template and causes a Kubernetes rollout after Fleet reconciles the
values commit.

The scheduled controller lives in the MyOTA monorepo at
[`.github/workflows/sync-testing-image-digests.yml`](https://github.com/myota-platform/myota/blob/main/.github/workflows/sync-testing-image-digests.yml).
It runs every five minutes or by manual dispatch, resolves each published
`testing` tag to an immutable digest, and opens a digest-only PR against
`myota/testing`. The old copy in the organization `.github` repository has
been removed. The monorepo workflow uses a short-lived GitHub App token limited
to this repository with Contents and Pull requests write permissions.

Configure `TESTING_DIGEST_APP_ID` as a repository variable and
`TESTING_DIGEST_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` as an Actions secret in `myota`, or make
them available through organization-level settings that include this
repository. The workflow skips with a warning when either value is missing.
After moving the workflow to `main`, no scheduled run has yet been observed;
run it manually once and verify credential access, digest PR creation, and
Fleet reconciliation before treating automation as operational.

The test namespace owns independent PostgreSQL databases, JetStream, SeaweedFS,
and observability storage. Application workloads do not point at the live
namespace. Test secrets use distinct credentials and token-signing keys;
location enrichment and production load-test cleanup are disabled.

## First deployment sequence

1. Create the `myota-test` namespace and its runtime Secrets from local
   `runtime-secrets` files. Never copy the live auth signing key, PostgreSQL
   credentials, or S3 credentials into this namespace.
2. Add a Fleet `GitRepo` targeting branch `testing` and path
   `deploy/helm/myota-test`. The committed values deliberately keep ingress
   disabled until the one-time data copy completes.
3. Wait for the test release's three database StatefulSets, migration Job,
   SeaweedFS, and NATS to become ready. Confirm all three test databases are
   independent from the services in namespace `myota`.
4. Copy current relational domain data from the live databases into the
   migrated test databases. Preserve the target migration ledger, seeded
   PostGIS reference tables, the `entity_type` catalog, and target-seeded
   `geodata_schema_feature` markers. Do not copy outbox
   delivery state, JetStream messages, consumer checkpoints, sessions,
   recovery tokens, or observability data; those are environment-specific and
   JetStream is not the durable domain archive. Each completed database gets
   its own namespace marker, so a later invocation skips databases that
   already copied successfully. A failed unmarked database copy is atomic;
   inspect that test database before retrying if it reports a row conflict.
5. Copy the live application buckets (`myota-award-assets`,
   `myota-award-signatures`, `myota-certificates`, `myota-adif`, and
   `myota-geodata-imports`) into test SeaweedFS. Do not copy Loki objects.
   Verify object counts and bytes before exposing the test hostnames.
6. The initial data seed is complete. Ingress was enabled through merged test
   branch PRs. Fleet serves `api.test.myota.top`, `admin.test.myota.top`, and
   `test.myota.top`; the participant Web UI routes `/v1` to the test API
   gateway and other paths to the test Web deployment.
7. Deployment verification on 2026-10-13 confirmed all test workloads Ready,
   HTTP 200 and trusted ACME TLS for the Admin and participant UIs, and a
   matching live/test inventory for the copied Geodata import bucket. See the
   [central test deployment record](https://github.com/myota-platform/myota-docs/blob/main/docs/operations/test-deployment.md).

The copy is a one-time initial seed, not continuous production-to-test
replication. Keep source credentials out of the test namespace after the copy.
The test deployment uses its own empty JetStream streams; do not replay live
messages into it.

### One-time copy commands

Run these only after Fleet has installed the release with ingress disabled and
all target migrations are complete:

```sh
bash scripts/copy-live-data-to-test.sh

kubectl get secret myota-s3-auth -n myota -o json \
  | jq '.metadata.name = "myota-live-copy-source"
        | .metadata.namespace = "myota-test"
        | del(.metadata.uid, .metadata.resourceVersion,
              .metadata.creationTimestamp, .metadata.managedFields,
              .metadata.ownerReferences)' \
  | kubectl apply -f -

kubectl create configmap myota-test-object-copy \
  -n myota-test \
  --from-file=copy-live-object-data.py=scripts/copy-live-object-data.py
```

Create the temporary object-copy Job with the test Geodata image and these
environment values (the credentials are Secret references, never literals):

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: myota-test-object-copy
  namespace: myota-test
spec:
  backoffLimit: 1
  activeDeadlineSeconds: 900
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never
      containers:
        - name: copy
          image: ghcr.io/myota-platform/myota-geodata-service:testing
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          command: [python3, /copy/copy-live-object-data.py]
          env:
            - {name: LIVE_S3_ENDPOINT, value: "http://myota-seaweedfs.myota.svc.cluster.local:8333"}
            - {name: TEST_S3_ENDPOINT, value: "http://myota-seaweedfs.myota-test.svc.cluster.local:8333"}
            - name: LIVE_S3_ACCESS_KEY
              valueFrom: {secretKeyRef: {name: myota-live-copy-source, key: access-key}}
            - name: LIVE_S3_SECRET_KEY
              valueFrom: {secretKeyRef: {name: myota-live-copy-source, key: secret-key}}
            - name: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
              valueFrom: {secretKeyRef: {name: myota-s3-auth, key: access-key}}
            - name: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
              valueFrom: {secretKeyRef: {name: myota-s3-auth, key: secret-key}}
          volumeMounts:
            - {name: script, mountPath: /copy, readOnly: true}
      volumes:
        - name: script
          configMap: {name: myota-test-object-copy}
```

Apply the Job, wait for completion, and inspect only its bucket-level count
output. Then remove `myota-test-object-copy`, `myota-test-object-copy` Job,
and `myota-live-copy-source` Secret. The relational copy script refuses to
seed if the live database contains user accounts; add an anonymization step
before copying identity data if that guard ever trips. Successful relational
copies get per-database namespace markers, so an interrupted run skips completed
databases on retry.

## Runtime requirements

The digest workflow resolves published testing tags for the platform runtime,
gateway, Identity, Programme, Geodata, Activity, Admin Web, and Web images.
When a digest changes, it updates only
`deploy/helm/myota-test/values-image-digests-testing.yaml`, opens a PR against
`testing`, and enables auto-merge. The normal pull-request workflows run the
Python, runtime-image, and Helm checks; branch protection must pass them before
the PR merges. Fleet then reconciles the new immutable digests in the isolated
`myota-test` release.

The workflow is in `main`, but its first post-move run has not yet been
observed. Verify that its App credentials are available to `myota` and that
the generated PR merges before relying on automatic image updates. Until that
verification, newly published tags do not update the test release.

Production values remain in `deploy/helm/myota`; this wrapper is a separate
Helm release and leaves the production namespace and PVCs untouched.
